## Build and deploy

If you just want to work on the code locally and then send push-requests on github you have to rename the `secret-template.json` file to `secret.json`. The `secret.json` is automaticly ignored from code checkin.

### Build

The following commands are now available within the project folder `$ grunt server` and `$ grunt build`.

- $ grunt build: Builds the code to /build
- $ grunt server: You get a local version of the code running at localhost. Code is build whenever you change a file in /app and automaticly loaded in your browser.


### Deploy

If you have the deploy authentication details, please add those to `secret.json`. You wil then have the following deploy commands available:

- $ grunt deploy-stage: deploys the code to staging.hiof.no
- $ grunt deploy-prod: deploys the code to hiof.no
